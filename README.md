# GreenFox Academy 0th week homework!

Hello there! This will be your first small project, in which you will learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Before you start, you will need to click the `Remix` button in the top right corner to create a copy of this project, so that you can edit yourself and then share it with anyone.

## What to do?

After you create your own copy of this project, you can start coding. While you develop your page, your changes will happen immediately in the preview window. If you don't see the preview window just click on **PREVIEW** in the bottom footer and hit **Open preview pane**. All your changes will be saved automatically.

## What's in this project?

On the left you'll see the files that make up your site, including HTML and CSS. In `Settings` you can set things to your liking (we recommend using auto refresh and text wrap). You can upload assets like images or audio in `Assets` folder. The rest is up to you and your imagination.

← `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `TODO-CSS.md`: Here you can find instructions for styling your page.

← `TODO-HTML.md`: Here you can find instructions for structuring your page.

← `index.html`: This is the main web page for your site. The HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure and content of the page using _elements_. You'll see references in the HTML to the CSS files. For more informations about HTML read **_[HTML basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)_** or checkout **_[HTML Youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc)_**.

← `style.css`: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files add styling rules to your content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. The style rules also make the image move when you click it. For more informations about CSS read **_[CSS basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics)_** or checkout **_[CSS Youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT)_**.

Open each file and check out the comments (in gray) for more info.
